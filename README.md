## More about the game

The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) in the empty squares. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

If all nine squares are filled and there is no winner, the game is a tie.
